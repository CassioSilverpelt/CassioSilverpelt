- 👋 Hi, I’m @CassioSilverpelt
- 👀 I’m interested in Video Games, Art in general, every animal you can think of (except for parasites) and learning new things about almost everything I can get my hands on.
- 🌱 I’m studying to become a programmer but still haven't quite decided what I want to focus in. I'm actually a bit inclined to work in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Fullstack or Security. A wide spread, I know. That is to say you can split my head with an axe and put each piece somewhere and I'll probably be happy as long as I'm learning and using said knowledge.
- I'm currently studying Java Cloud Native and LLMs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything of interest or importance, really. I just don't know where to start.
- 📫 How to reach me: try 'cassio_mvianna@outlook.com'.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him. I'm all for any minorities as long as you're respectful to everyone.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to own multiple ant farms and tarantulas in the past. I'm naturally curious and very talkative given the chance.
